# Bookdown Demo Site for Pharmasug 2021

Bookdown site is linked [here](https://bms63.github.io/cp_book_demo/)(target="blank")

This reposoitroy is the minimal code needed to get started on a bookdown website in the context of clinical programming.  It is loosely based on the paper from the Pharmasug 2021 conference paper that I wrote entitled:  [Bookdown and Blogdown: Using R packages to document and communicate new processes to Clinical Programming](https://www.pharmasug.org/us/2021/papers.html#SI-108)(target="blank") There are lots of great examples out there on using bookdown and blogdown.  This one just tries to show it off from a clincial programming persepctive that is larglely staffed by SAS programmers.

The site is hosted by github pages via the publish branch.
