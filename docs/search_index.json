Those within the R Implementation group have curated a select group of resources to help ease into the use of R. We have also created several use case example of creating displays within our company and demonstrate how to do comparison using diffdf 1.1 Using R at Pharma Inc. We have developed several in-depth trainings for getting up and running R. Training 1 Training 2 Training 3 External Training that we recommend: The John Hopkins Data Science Classes on Cousera R for Data Science 1.2 Developing Code RStudio is the preferred Interactive Development Environment (IDE) for developing code at Pharma Inc. The video below will give you a brief tutorial on the different parts of the IDE. 1.3 Accessing the data # Access to SDTM data in Production sdtmdata &lt;- &quot;/compound/studyid/repeff/sdtm&quot; # Access to ADaM data in Production adamdata &lt;- &quot;/compound/studyid/repeff/adamdata&quot; "],["use-cases.html", "Chapter 2 Use Cases", " Chapter 2 Use Cases # Load Packages library(diffdf) library(dplyr) library(tidyr) library(haven) # Access the Adam and dddata folder # Load in the datasets from HARP adae_orig &lt;- read_sas(&quot;./adamdata/adae.sas7bdat&quot;) adsl_orig &lt;- read_sas(&quot;./adamdata/adsl.sas7bdat&quot;) # Getting Pop Counts adsl &lt;- adsl_orig %&gt;% mutate(TRT01AN = 9, TRT01A = &quot;Total&quot;) %&gt;% bind_rows(adsl_orig) bigN &lt;- adsl %&gt;% filter(SAFFL == &quot;Y&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(TRT01AN) %&gt;% summarise(N=n()) %&gt;% ungroup() # Pop counts from ADAE adae &lt;- adae_orig %&gt;% mutate(TRT01AN = 9, TRT01A = &quot;Total&quot;) %&gt;% bind_rows(adae_orig) adae1 &lt;- adae %&gt;% filter(SAFFL == &quot;Y&quot;) %&gt;% select(STUDYID, TRT01AN, TRT01A, USUBJID, AEDECOD, AESOC) %&gt;% distinct(.keep_all = TRUE) # Overall Counts adae2al &lt;- adae1 %&gt;% group_by(TRT01AN) %&gt;% summarise(n = n_distinct(USUBJID)) %&gt;% mutate(AESOC = &quot;&quot;, AEDECOD = &quot;ANY EVENT&quot;, summaryLevel = 1) %&gt;% ungroup() # SOC counts adae2sc &lt;- adae1 %&gt;% group_by(AESOC, TRT01AN) %&gt;% summarise(n = n_distinct(USUBJID)) %&gt;% mutate(AEDECOD = &quot;Any event&quot;, summaryLevel = 2) %&gt;% ungroup() # PT counts adae2pt &lt;- adae1 %&gt;% group_by(AESOC, AEDECOD, TRT01AN) %&gt;% summarise(n = n_distinct(USUBJID)) %&gt;% mutate(summaryLevel = 3) %&gt;% ungroup() # Calculate Percentages and format cells with counts and percents q_t_ae_fmt &lt;- rbind(adae2al, adae2pt, adae2sc) %&gt;% inner_join(bigN, by = c(&quot;TRT01AN&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate( per = ((n / N) * 100), aval = n_percent(n, per, dem_pl = 1) ) %&gt;% select(-n, -N, -per) # Long to Wide # Updated to Pivot Wider q_t_ae_sum_tsp &lt;- q_t_ae_fmt %&gt;% pivot_wider(id_cols = c(&quot;TRT01AN&quot;,&quot;summaryLevel&quot;, &quot;AESOC&quot;, &quot;AEDECOD&quot;), names_from=TRT01AN, names_prefix=&quot;tt_ac&quot;, values_from=aval, values_fill = list(aval = &quot;0&quot;)) "],["using-diffdf-for-comparison.html", "Chapter 3 Using diffdf for Comparison", " Chapter 3 Using diffdf for Comparison diffdf(t_ae_sum, q_t_ae_sum_tsp, keys = c(&quot;AESOC&quot;, &quot;summaryLevel&quot;, &quot;AEDECOD&quot;), file = &quot;qc_t_ae_sum.lst&quot;) "]]
